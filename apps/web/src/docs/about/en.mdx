# About

Welcome to the Modded Minecraft Wiki, a common place for everyone to host and share documentation of their Minecraft
projects. These currently include mods, modpacks, resource packs, data packs, shaders and plugins.

The Modded Minecraft Wiki is built to suit the very needs of Minecraft modders and players alike. It provides
intuitive navigation, a clean user interface, project browser and features for authors to make writing documentation
a piece of cake.

These include versioning, localization, custom components (recipes, assets, etc.), gradle integration,
project management and more.

- üåê **Localization**: Translate your docs into world languages
- üöπ **Accessible**: Intuitive and responsive user interface
- ü§ù **Open**: Let your users contribute without any programming knowledge necessary
- üí∏ **Free**: Hosting docs on our website is completely free of charge!

### Project documentation

To edit a documentation page, use the `Edit page on GitHub` button found at the bottom of the right side panel.

As project documentation is sourced from GitHub repositories, you can either use the GitHub web editor, or clone the
repository and make changes locally. Then, once you're done making changes, you can submit a Pull Request to the
upstream repository and wait for it to be reviewed / merged by a maintainer.
