project management and more.

### Mod documentation

To edit a mod documentation page, use the `Edit page on GitHub` button found at the bottom of the right side panel.

As mod documentation is sourced from GitHub repositories, you can either use the GitHub web editor, or clone the
repository and make changes locally. Then, once you're done making changes, you can submit a Pull Request to the
upstream repository and wait for it to be reviewed / merged by a maintainer.
