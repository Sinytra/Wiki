# Author guide

Get started hosting your project's documentation on our wiki!

This guide provides information on local development and the documentation format.
For a guide on publishing docs onto our website, please see the [Publishing](./publishing) page instead.

## Prerequisites

In order to start hosting documentation on our wiki, your project only needs to meet a few minimal requirements:

- Be hosted on a <GitHubIcon className="inline-block mb-1 mx-1" width={16} height={16} /> GitHub repository
(both private and public repositories work!)
- Be approved on either
<ModrinthIcon className="inline-block mb-1 mx-1 text-brand-modrinth" width={16} height={16} /> [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) or
<CurseForgeColorIcon className="inline-block mb-0.5 mx-1" width={16} height={16} /> [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)
- At the time of registration, CurseForge projects MUST have the GitHub repository linked as the project's source code
url (this is currently required to verify project ownership). Modrinth projects can also be easily verified using your
Modrinth account

- Additionally, the person registering the project to the wiki should have **Maintain** or **Admin** access to its
GitHub repository

## <GradleColorIcon width={32} height={32} className="inline-block mr-1" /> Gradle plugin companion

We provide an excellent wiki companion [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiToolkit) to help you with
authoring documentation.

Its features include:
- Local real-time, accurate preview of your documentation in the exact same look as it will have once uploaded to the wiki
- Automatically generating asset renders of inventory models for all mod items
- Revalidating documentation after publishing

A complete usage guide can be found on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiToolkit).
