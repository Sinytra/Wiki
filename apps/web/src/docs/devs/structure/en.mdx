# Folder structure

Start by creating a new directory inside your project. This can be located at any path of your choice.
For example, you can use `docs/(your modid here)` or simply `docs`, both are equally valid.

<Callout>
    We also support scenarios where multiple projects have their documentation hosted in a single repository, as long
    as they're located in separate folders.
    This is useful if you're looking to store documentation for multiple of your projects in a single place.
</Callout>

A minimal example folder layout may look like this:

```
docs
├── blocks
│   ├── generator.mds
│   └── _meta.json
├── introduction.mdx
├── _meta.json
└── sinytra-wiki.json
```

<details>
    <summary>Show complete example</summary>

    Here is a complete example including assets and translations.

    ```
    docs
    ├── .assets
    │   └── examplemod
    │       └── generator.png
    ├── .translated
    │   └── de_de
    │       └── blocks
    │           ├── generator.mdx
    │           └── _meta.json
    ├── blocks
    │   ├── generator.mds
    │   └── _meta.json
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── _meta.json
    └── sinytra-wiki.json
    ```
</details>

Let's talk about what each of these files does:
- `sinytra-wiki.json`: The main metadata file, the "heart" of the documentation package, carries information about the
project. For its content format, see the complete explanation below.
- `_meta.json`: Can be placed in the root folder as well as each subfolder. Provides display names for files and
folders, which are shown in the documentation navigation sidebar on the wiki, and also specifies the order in which
they are displayed. If not provided, fallback display names are generated automatically.
- `*.mdx` files: Contain documentation contents. To learn more about the MDX format, please see their
[website](https://mdxjs.com/). As MDX compiles to JavaScript, the Wiki imposes certain restrictions on what components
and tags can be used in addition to standard Markdown. For a complete description, please read below.

### Assets

<Callout>
    Save yourself time manually exporting all assets using our companion [**Gradle plugin**](#-gradle-plugin-companion),
    which integrates with popular mod loader toolchains and can **automatically generate rendered assets** for you!
</Callout>

Assets are used to display images of items, blocks and other project content across the website. These can be used as
part of crafting recipes, sidebar information or custom components.

Assets are identified using [resource locations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_location) using the same syntax as
in the game itself. It's recommened to match asset names with the in-game IDs of the objects they belong to.

Rendered project assets including **both items and blocks** should be placed under `.assets/(modid)` inside the
documentation directory, where `modid` is the namespace of each texture you wish to provide.

Each asset **must be in `.png` format**. The name of the file is up to your choice.

For example, `examplemod:generator` would point to `(root)/.assets/examplemod/generator.png`.

### Translation

Documentation can be localized into various languages supported by the wiki. A complete list can be found in the
language selection dropdown located on the right-most part of the navigation header.

Localized files must be placed under `.translated/(lang)` inside the documentation directory, where
`(lang)` is the desired language code in `(lang)_(region)` format. Currently, all regions match the language, so
it's sufficient to take the target language code and complete the region to be the same as the language
(e.g. German translations (`de`) would be placed under `.translated/de_de`).

The localized folder structure follows the same layout as root. Both documentation content files (`.mdx`) and folder
metadata (`_meta.json`) may be translated. Translated content takes precedence over the default locale when being
loaded. However, untranslated files will still be shown even when the locale is non-default, therefore it is
recommended to translate all files whenever possible.

### Custom homepage

The wiki provides a dedicated landing page for documentation called the "Homepage". By default, this shows the
linked platform project's description.

If you'd like to provide your own contents instead, you can do so by creating a `_homepage.mdx` file in your
documentation's root folder (at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`). The file's contents follow the same
[formatting](devs/format) as regular documentation pages, except for frontmatter metadata (e.g. title), which is ignored.
The homepage's title will always match the project's name, whereas the sidebar will display various information about
the platform project, such as the project's authors, categories and available mc versions.
