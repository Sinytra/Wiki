# Documentation format

The wiki uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files as its documentation format. In additon, [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
(GFM) is also available using [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). 

If you're not yet familiar with MDX, don't worry - it is an extension of the simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
format with added JSX capabilities, meaning you can include fancy custom components in your documentation,
such as crafting recipes.

These features are purely optional, and you can always stick to using standard Markdown in your documentation. However,
the file extension must remain `.mdx`.

#### Limitations

Because MDX can potentially allow unwanted code injection on the server, we sanitize all sources before they're rendered,
which can result in certain features of MDX being unavailable. That said, if there's a safe feature you'd like to use in
your documentation that isn't available on the wiki, please open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki/issues).

## Metadata

Markdown page metadata, also known as simply "Frontmatter" is used by the wiki to provide additional information about
a page or in-game content. It's located at the very beginning of each file in YAML format.

Information obtained from frontmatter is then displayed in the right sidebar of each page under "Information".
Usually, this includes an icon of the block/item along with its name, id, source project and other handy information.

If your page is not related to a specific object, you can hide all metadata and ignore their values by setting
`hide_meta: true`. The `title` attribute will still be used, and we recommend providing it at all times.

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
---

Content comes here
```

Here's an overview of supported attributes:

- `title` - Display name of the page, shown in the content heading and the browser tab title.
Replaces the `h1` heading in docs.
  - Type: `string`
  - Example: `Fancy Block`
- `hide_meta` - Hides sidebar meta information. As a results, all other attributes will be ignored.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `id` - In-game resource location ID of the content shown. If a matching asset with the same location is found in the
documentation root's asset folder, it will be used as the `icon`.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:generator`
- `icon` - Resource location of an asset that will be shown as the documented item's icon. Its size should be at least
128x128 pixels.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:fancy_generator`
- `hide_icon` - Hides the project icon, showing a generic placeholder instead.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `type` - Can be `block`, `item` or `other`
  - Type: `string`
- `custom` - A map of custom attributes you wish to display in the sidebar.
  - Type: `string` -> `string` map
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    custom:
      Category: Machines
    ```

    ```markdown

    id: examplemod:generator
    icon: examplemod:fancy_generator
    type: block
    custom:
      Subcategory: Machines

    Content comes here
    ```

## Next steps

Once your documentation folder is set up, and you're satisfied with the looks and content of your documentation,
it is time to get it published on the wiki.
