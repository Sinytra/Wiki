# Interactive components

Interactive components can be used in [Content Pages](../folder_structure/pages/content_pages) to display dynamic
information based on [game files](../folder_structure/game_data) in the project.

## Prefab

Prefab components could be described as "drag and drop" building blocks that provide prebuilt parts of documentation.

They usually don't require specifying any attributes and can "magically" resolve them from the context.

### `PrefabObtaining`

Adds a "Recipe" section to the page that displays crafting recipes that can be used to obtain the described item.

*This component requires adding recipes to [game data](../game_data) in your project.*

```jsx
<PrefabObtaining />
```

### `PrefabUsage`

Adds a "Usage" section to the page that contains a list of items this item can be used to obtain.

*This component requires adding recipes to [game data](../game_data) in your project.*

```jsx
<PrefabUsage />
```

## Navigation

Navigation utility components to make navigating across pages easier, even for referencing vanilla items.

### `ContentLink`

This component allows you to reference any in-game object via its ID, including vanilla items, and creates a link that
leads to its page, if it exists.

The Content Link component takes a single attribute named `id`, which specifies the in-game item to navigate to.
This can be an item from the current project or vanilla.

Project content pages are matched based on the `id` frontmatter [attribute](../folder_structure/pages/content_pages#metadata).
Additionally, non-vanilla items can omit the link text to display the item's page title instead.

```mdx
{/* Links to https://minecraft.wiki/w/redstone */}
<ContentLink id="redstone">Redstone</ContentLink>

{/* Shows "Electric Furnace", links to content page from the same project */}
<ContentLink id="examplemod:electric_furnace" />

{/* Same as above - with custom display text */}
Click <ContentLink id="examplemod:electric_furnace">here</ContentLink> to learn more.
