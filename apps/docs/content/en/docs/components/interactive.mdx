# Interactive components

Interactive components can be used in [Content Pages](../folder_structure/pages/content_pages) to display dynamic
information based on [game files](../folder_structure/game_data) in the project.

## Prefab

Prefab components could be described as "drag and drop" building blocks that provide prebuilt parts of documentation.

They usually don't require specifying any attributes and can "magically" resolve them from the context.
