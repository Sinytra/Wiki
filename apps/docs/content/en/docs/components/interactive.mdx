# Interactive components

Interactive components can be used in [Content Pages](../folder_structure/pages/content_pages) to display dynamic
information based on [game files](../folder_structure/game_data) in the project.

## Prefab

Prefab components could be described as "drag and drop" building blocks that provide prebuilt parts of documentation.

They usually don't require specifying any attributes and can "magically" resolve them from the context.

### `PrefabObtaining`

Adds a "Recipe" section to the page that displays crafting recipes that can be used to obtain the described item.
The item's ID is obtained from the page's frontmatter `id` property.

*This component requires adding recipes to [game data](/docs/folder_structure/game_data) in your project.*

```jsx
<PrefabObtaining />
```

### `PrefabUsage`

Adds a "Usage" section to the page that contains a list of items this item can be used to obtain.
The item's ID is obtained from the page's frontmatter `id` property.

*This component requires adding recipes to [game data](/docs/folder_structure/game_data) in your project.*

```jsx
<PrefabUsage />
```
