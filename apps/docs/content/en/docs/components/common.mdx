## Builtin

### Video embeds

Embed YouTube videos using the `VideoEmbed` component. To use this component, you will need to get the ID of the video
you want to embed, which can be easily copied from the video URL's `v` parameter.

For example, the ID for `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_WnAEKoeA4` would be `Y_WnAEKoeA4`.

You can then directly pass this ID to the component as shown below.

```mdx
<VideoEmbed id="Y_WnAEKoeA4"/>
```

### Code blocks

Code blocks on the Wiki are enhanced with syntax highlighting and can optionally display a file name as well.

````md
<!-- With language and file name -->
```json my-file.json
{
    "id": "hello-world"
}
```

<!-- Language only -->
```json
{
    "id": "hello-world"
}
```
````

## Styling

### `Callout`

Draw the reader's attention with callouts.

#### Properties

- `variant`
  - Can be either of [`default`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`] (default: `default`)
- `title`
  - Custom title to display. Optional

#### Code

```jsx
<Callout>
    This is a sample callout
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info">
    This is a sample info callout
</Callout>
```

### `CodeTabs`

The Wiki implements CodeHike's [CodeTabs](https://codehike.org/docs/code/tabs) component as shown below.

This can be useful if you want to show separate variants for Gradle/Kotlin DSL code in developer documentation.

#### Code

````jsx
<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs main.js
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
    const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit
    dolor = sit - amet(dolor)
    return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : []
}
```

```css !!tabs styles.css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

</CodeTabs>
````

## Game content

### `Asset`

<Callout type="important">
   It is recommened to use the shorthand [asset syntax](../folder_structure/pages#extensions) for displaying assets.
</Callout>

Displays an [asset](../folder_structure/assets) image.

#### Properties

- `location`*
  - Resource Location of the asset you wish to display

All properties of `img` except for `src` are also accepted.

#### Code

```jsx
<Asset width={64} height={64} location="minecraft:furnace" title="Furnace" />
```

## Icons

The entire collection of [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) is available to use in documentation files via
React components.

Names of icon components consist of an icon's "component name" (which you can find on the website or make an educated
guess by converting the icon id to PascalCase (e.g. `align-vertical-justify-start` -> `AlignVerticalJustifyStart`)
and the `Icon` suffix.

All properties supported by [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) are available as well.

### Code

```jsx
<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1} />
```

### Result

<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1} className="mt-5" />

## Recipes

<Callout type="important">
    In content pages, prefer using [Prefab components](interactive#prefab) to show obtaining and usage.
</Callout>

### `ProjectRecipe`

Displays an interactive [recipe](../folder_structure/game_data#recipes) for a single item. This is similar to pressing
`R` on your keyboard when using in-game recipe viewers.

#### Properties

- `id`*
  - ID of the recipe to display

### `RecipeUsage`

Displays a list of items that can be crafted/obtained through [recipes](../folder_structure/game_data#recipes) using
this item. This is similar to pressing `U` on your keyboard when using in-game recipe viewers.

#### Properties

- `id`*
  - ID of the item to show the usage of

## Navigation

<Callout type="important">
    While these components are documented here for the sake of completeness, it is recommened to use the shorthand
    [link format](../folder_structure/pages#extensions) for linking to other pages.
</Callout>

Navigation utility components to make navigating across pages easier, even for referencing vanilla items.

### `DocsLink`

Allows linking to documentation pages within the same project.

The Docs Link takes a single attribute named `path`, which specified the path to the page to link, relative to the
project root.

You can omit the body to show the page title instead.

```mdx
<DocsLink path="getting_started/first_steps"/>
```

### `ContentLink`

This component allows you to reference any in-game object via its ID, including vanilla items, and creates a link that
leads to its page, if it exists.

The Content Link component takes a single attribute named `id`, which specifies the in-game item to navigate to.
This can be an item from the current project or vanilla.

Project content pages are matched based on the `id` frontmatter [attribute](../folder_structure/pages/content_pages#metadata).
Additionally, non-vanilla items can omit the link text to display the item's page title instead.

```mdx
{/* Links to https://minecraft.wiki/w/redstone */}
<ContentLink id="redstone">Redstone</ContentLink>

{/* Shows "Electric Furnace", links to content page from the same project */}
<ContentLink id="examplemod:electric_furnace" />

{/* Same as above - with custom display text */}
Click <ContentLink id="examplemod:electric_furnace">here</ContentLink> to learn more.
```
