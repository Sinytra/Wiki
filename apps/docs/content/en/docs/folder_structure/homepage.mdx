# Homepage

The wiki provides a dedicated landing page for documentation called the "Homepage". By default, this shows the
linked platform project's description.

If you'd like to provide your own contents instead, you can do so by creating a `_homepage.mdx` file in your
documentation's root folder (at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`). The file's contents follow the same
[formatting](devs/format) as regular documentation pages, except for frontmatter metadata (e.g. title), which is ignored.
The homepage's title will always match the project's name, whereas the sidebar will display various information about
the platform project, such as the project's authors, categories and available mc versions.
