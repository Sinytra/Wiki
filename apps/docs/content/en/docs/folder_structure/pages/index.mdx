# Pages

Page files are used to write the actual documentation text for projects.

## Page types

There are two types of pages available on the wiki, both of which can be used **at the same time**.

### <InlineGameItem id="grass_block" /> [Content pages](pages/content_pages)

- Found under the "Content" tab on the Wiki

- Traditional [wiki style](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Furnace)

- No reading order

- Recommended for all **in-game content**, such as blocks, items, entities, but also abstract various **concepts**
  and mechanics your mod may add

Content pages allow you to interactively reference in-game content and provide a broader set of components you can use.

### <InlineGameItem id="book" /> [Documentation pages](pages/docs_pages)

- Found under the "Documentation" tab on the Wiki

- Contain guide-like documentation similar to this website you're browsing right now

- Implied reading order

- Recommended for **guides** and API / **developer documentation**

## Format

The wiki uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files as its documentation format. In additon, [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
(GFM) is also available using [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).

If you're not yet familiar with MDX, don't worry - it is an extension of the simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
format with added JSX capabilities, meaning you can include fancy custom components in your documentation,
such as crafting recipes.

These features are purely optional, and you can always stick to using standard Markdown in your documentation. However,
the file extension must remain `.mdx`.

### Extensions

We provide an extended link format that lets you quickly reference other pages within the same project.

#### Content page links

To link to [Content pages](pages/content_pages), use the ID metadata attribute of the page you want to link to,
prefixed with `@`.

For example:
```md
<!-- Uses page title as link text -->
[](@examplemod:electric_furnace)

<!-- Uses custom link text -->
Click [here](@examplemod:electric_furnace) to learn more.
```

#### Documentation page links

To link to [Documentation pages](pages/docs_pages), use the path of the page you want to link to (relative to the project
root), prefixed with `$`.

For example:
```md
<!-- Uses page title as link text -->
[]($tutorials/getting_started)

<!-- Uses custom link text -->
Click [here]($tutorials/getting_started) to read the first tutorial.
```

### Limitations

Because MDX can potentially allow unwanted code injection on the server, we sanitize all sources before they're rendered,
which can result in certain features of MDX being unavailable. That said, if there's a safe feature you'd like to use in
your documentation that isn't available on the wiki, please open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki/issues).

## Metadata

Markdown page metadata, also known as simply **Frontmatter** is used by the wiki to provide additional information about
a page or in-game content. It's located at the very beginning of each file in YAML format.

Information obtained from frontmatter is then displayed in the right sidebar of each page under "Information".
Usually, this includes an icon of the block/item along with its name, id, source project and other handy information.

If your page is not related to a specific object, you can hide all metadata and ignore their values
(except for `title`) by setting `hide_meta: true`.

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
---

Content comes here
```

Here's an overview of supported attributes:

- `title` - Display name of the page, shown in the content heading and the browser tab title.<br/>
If a `h1` heading is available, it will be used instead.
  - Type: `string`
  - Example: `Fancy Block`
- `hide_meta` - Hides sidebar meta information. As a results, all other attributes will be ignored.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `id` - In-game resource location ID of the content shown. If a matching asset with the same location is found in the
documentation root's asset folder, it will be used as the `icon`.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:generator`
- `icon` - Resource location of an asset that will be shown as the documented item's icon. Its size should be at least
128x128 pixels.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:fancy_generator`
- `hide_icon` - Hides the icon, showing a generic placeholder instead.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `type` - Can be `block`, `item` or `other`
  - Type: `string`
- `custom` - A map of custom attributes you wish to display in the sidebar.
  - Type: `string` -> `string` map
  - Example:
  ```yaml
  custom:
    Category: Machines
  ```

<details>
    <summary>Show complete metadata example</summary>

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Generator
    id: examplemod:generator
    icon: examplemod:fancy_generator
    type: block
    custom:
      Subcategory: Machines
    ---

    Content comes here
    ```
