# Content pages

Content pages follow a traditional wiki [layout](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Furnace), and are intended to describe
**in-game content** *(such as items, block, entities)*, but also various abstract concepts *(e.g. mana, energy...)*.

<p className="mt-5 space-x-2">
    <InlineGameItem id="grass_block" size={32} />
    <InlineGameItem id="furnace" size={32} />
    <InlineGameItem id="iron_ingot" size={32} />
    <InlineGameItem id="experience_bottle" size={32} />
    <InlineGameItem id="piglin_head" size={32} />
</p>

Their **key feature** is that they can display in-game data on the website in a highly intuitive manner.
This namely includes item/block **properties**, **recipes** (both vanilla and custom), crafting **usage**
and other data.

On the Wiki website, these are located under the project's "Content" tab.

## Placement

Content pages are all placed inside the `.content` folder within the project.

They must be further nested at least by a single level to "shallow" cateogories, and can be further nested by another
level to create "deep" categories.

<FileTree>
    <FileTreeFolder name="<root>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFolder name=".content" defaultOpen>
            <FileTreeFolder name="tools" defaultOpen comment="Shallow category">
                <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>

                <FileTreeFile name="sword.mdx"/>
            </FileTreeFolder>

            <FileTreeFolder name="machines" defaultOpen comment="Deep category">

                <FileTreeFolder name="basic" defaultOpen>
                    <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>

                    <FileTreeFile name="electric_furnace.mdx"/>
                </FileTreeFolder>

                <FileTreeFolder name="advanced">
                    <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>

                    <FileTreeFile name="grinder.mdx"/>
                </FileTreeFolder>

                <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
            </FileTreeFolder>

            <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
        </FileTreeFolder>
    </FileTreeFolder>
</FileTree>

## Authoring

Content pages are traditionally focused on describing a specific object or concept rather than providing broader
tutorials. These descriptions often include technical information, such as IDs, stats and relations.

This is where the Wiki becomes a huge helper. It saves you time doing the boring work of *copy-pasting reference values*
from the game and gives you the ability to **reuse locales, recipes, tags** and other data files from your project to be
displayed in content pages, allowing you to focus on writing what's **important**.

When writing content pages, we encourage you to take full advantage of helper components offered by the wiki and
[automate](../../features/gradle.mdx) copying/generating data files in the project.

### Checklist

Content pages use a broader context which may not always be clear. Below a general list of things to keep in mind
when authoring documentation.
It also shows how in-game data files are referenced by content pages and by extent, interactive components.

**Advice for writing top-notch content pages:**

- [x] Specify the ID frontmatter [attribute](#metadata)

<p/>

- [x] Easily [link](../../components/interactive#navigation) to other content pages

<p/>

- [x] Include your item's name in a [Language File](../game_data) to be displayed in recipes and tags

<p/>

- [x] Add [Obtaining](../../components/interactive#prefabobtaining) and [Usage](../../components/interactive#prefabusage)
  to show how your item can be crafted and used in other recipes

<p/>

- [x] Define [Item Properties](../game_data) to include in the sidebar

<p/>

- [x] Add a [Changelog](../pages#changelog) to inform users of past changes

## Metadata

<Callout type="important">
    Make sure to always specify the `id` attribute for pages covering in-game objects!
</Callout>

Pages covering in-game content **must** specify the object's in-game `id` in frontmatter attributes. This is
crucial to interact with game data files in the project.

By default, this ID doubles as the location of the page icon, which is sourced from [assets](../assets).

```mdx
---
id: examplemod:electric_furnace
---
```

### Sideabar

Content pages contain a sidebar that displays various properties and stats about in-game items, which are sourced
from the [Item Properties](../game_data) file. Additional properties can be specified in frontmatter
[attributes](../pages#metadata).

## Interaction

Content pages allow you to make excellent use of dynamic [components](../../components/interactive) provided by the
Wiki, which use project game files behind the scenes to display information.

Read the [Game Data](../game_data) page to learn more about how you can easily include game data files in your Wiki
project.

## Example

### Describing an in-game object

Below you can find a real-life content page example from [Modular Force Field Systems](https://modrinth.com/mod/mffs)
describing the Force Field Projector machine.

It demonstrates the clever inclusion of content links, recipe obtaining/usage and changelogs in the page body.

```mdx

id: mffs:projector
type: block

# Force Field Projector

The Force Field Projector is a fundamental part of the MFFS family of machines.
It uses Fortron energy to project force fields of various shapes and sizes into
the world.

<PrefabObtaining />

## Operation

To make a force field, give the Force Field Projector a supply of
Fortron by linking it to a nearby <ContentLink id="mffs:fortron_capacitor"/>.

Decide which force field shape to create by crafting one of the projector mode items.
Right-click the Projector and place the projector mode item into the central (red)
slot surrounded by outwardly facing arrows.

Craft a number of Scale Module items and place them into the left-hand slot matrix
of the Force Field Projector's GUI. Each Scale Module used in the Projector's matrix
slots will increase the force field radius by one block.

To be able to walk through a force field, a
<ContentLink id="mffs:biometric_identifier"/> is needed.

## Upgradability

A Force Field Projector may be augmented with various modules.

These general modules have the following effects:

- <ContentLink id="mffs:scale_module" />: Adjusts the shape of a projected
  force field
- <ContentLink id="mffs:speed_module" />: Allows the Projector to generate
  a force field more quickly
- <ContentLink id="mffs:capacity_module" />: Increases the amount of Fortron
  the Projector is able to store

<PrefabUsage />
```

### Describing a concept

Below is a simple example of describing a mechanism or system your mod adds to the game.
In our case, this is Fortron energy provided by [Modular Force Field Systems](https://modrinth.com/mod/mffs).

As Fortron does not exist as an in-game item, we've omitted the `id` attribute and specified the page icon explicitly.

```mdx
---
icon: mffs:misc/fortron
type: other

# Fortron

Fortron is a form of energy that MFFS machines use as a source of power.

It is produced and stored initially by the <ContentLink id="mffs:coercion_deriver"/>
to then be transferred to other machines by the
<ContentLink id="mffs:fortron_capacitor"/>.

Another source of Fortron energy is a creative-only item known as the
Infinite Power Card. It can be placed directly into a Fortron Capacitor
(left most item slot) to provide an infinite supply of Fortron.

Fortron is able to exist as a liquid. It may be pumped directly from
a Capacitor and manipulated in the same way Water or Lava can.
