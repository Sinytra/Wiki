# Translations

Documentation can be localized into various languages supported by the wiki. This applies to all types of pages,
folder metadata as well as some game files (such as language files).

## Supported languages

Below is a table of all currently supported translation target languages on the Wiki. The `code` corresponds to the
name of the folder to use when translating documentation, explained in detail below.

<SystemLocalesTable />

### Didn't find your language?

If your desired language does not appear in the table, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.sinytra.org)
or [GitHub](https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki) and we'll be happy to add it.

## Placement

<FileTree>
    <FileTreeFolder name="<root>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFolder name=".translated" defaultOpen>
            <FileTreeFolder name="de_de" defaultOpen>
                <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
                <FileTreeFile name="introduction.mdx"/>
            </FileTreeFolder>
        </FileTreeFolder>

        <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
        <FileTreeFile name="introduction.mdx"/>
    </FileTreeFolder>
</FileTree>

Localized files must be placed under `.translated/<lang>` inside the documentation directory, where
`<lang>` is the code for your desired language as it appears in the table above.

## Layout

The localized folder structure follows the same layout as root.

Both documentation content files (`.mdx`) and folder metadata (`_meta.json`) may be translated.

Translated content **takes precedence** over the default locale when being loaded. However, untranslated files will
still be shown even when the locale is non-default, therefore it is recommended to translate all files whenever possible.
