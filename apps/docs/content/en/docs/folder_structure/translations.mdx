# Translations

Documentation can be localized into various languages supported by the wiki. A complete list can be found in the
language selection dropdown located on the right-most part of the navigation header.

Localized files must be placed under `.translated/(lang)` inside the documentation directory, where
`(lang)` is the desired language code in `(lang)_(region)` format. Currently, all regions match the language, so
it's sufficient to take the target language code and complete the region to be the same as the language
(e.g. German translations (`de`) would be placed under `.translated/de_de`).

The localized folder structure follows the same layout as root. Both documentation content files (`.mdx`) and folder
metadata (`_meta.json`) may be translated. Translated content takes precedence over the default locale when being
loaded. However, untranslated files will still be shown even when the locale is non-default, therefore it is
recommended to translate all files whenever possible.
