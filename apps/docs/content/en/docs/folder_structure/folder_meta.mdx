# Folder metadata

Folder metadata provides additional information for pages, such as:
- The **display names** of folders and files. If not provided, the wiki will use automatically generated display names.
- The **ordering** of sidebar entries. By default, folders are shown first, followed by regular files, all sorted
alphabetically.

To avoid potential unwanted display errors, we recommend **always** providing complete folder metadata in your
documentation.

## Placement

Folder metadata is stored in a file called `_meta.json` and can be placed **inside any folder** within the
documentation directory, **including the root** directory itself (e.g. at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`).

<FileTree>
    <FileTreeFolder name="<root>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFolder name="...arbitrarily_nested_path" defaultOpen>
            <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
        </FileTreeFolder>
        <FileTreeFile name="_meta.json"/>
    </FileTreeFolder>
</FileTree>

## File Format

The folder metadata file consists of string key-value pairs, where the keys represent the name of a file or a folder,
and the values are their display name.

When specifying a file name, the full name including the extension is required. Specifying nested paths is not
supported - instead, create a folder metadata file at the nested path.

For example:

```json filename="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": "Blocks",
    "items": "Completely custom name",
    "introduction.mdx": "Introduction"
}
```

## Icons

You can add icons for each metadata entry to display in the navigation sidebar by converting the meta value to an object
and supplying the icon's name as shown below.

The supplied icon name should be a [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) component name (without the `Icon` suffix).

To hide the folder icon completely, specify `null`.

```json filename="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": {
        "name": "Blocks",
        "icon": "Box"
    }
}
```
