# Folder metadata

Folder metadata provides additional information for the documentation page navigation sidebar, such as:
- The **display names** of folders and files. If not provided, the wiki will use automatically generated display names.
- The **ordering** of sidebar entries. By default, folders are shown first, followed by regular files, all sorted
alphabetically.

To avoid potential unwanted display errors, we recommend **always** providing complete folder metadata in your
documentation.

## File Format

The folder metadata json consists of string key-value pairs, where the keys represent the name of a file or a folder,
and the values are their display name. When specifying a file name, the full name including the extension is required.

Folder metadata is contained in a file called `_meta.json` and can be placed **inside any folder** within the
documentation directory, **including the root** directory itself (e.g. at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`).

For example:

```json filename="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": "Blocks",
    "items": "Completely custom name",
    "introduction.mdx": "Introduction"
}
```

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/_meta.schema.json).

## Icons

You can add icons for each metadata entry to display in the navigation sidebar by converting the meta value to an object
and supplying the icon's name as shown below.

The supplied icon name should be a [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) component name (without the `Icon` suffix).
More information on icon names can be found on the [Format](./format#icons) page.

To hide the folder icon completely, specify `null`.

```json filename="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": {
        "name": "Blocks",
        "icon": "Box"
    }
}
```
