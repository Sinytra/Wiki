# Overview

## Example

A minimal example folder layout may look like this:

```
docs
├── blocks
│   ├── generator.mdx
│   └── _meta.json
├── introduction.mdx
├── _meta.json
└── sinytra-wiki.json
```

<details>

    Here is a complete example including assets and translations.

    ```
    docs
    ├── .assets
    │   └── examplemod
    │       └── generator.png
    ├── .translated
    │   └── de_de
    │       └── blocks
    │           ├── generator.mdx
    │           └── _meta.json
    ├── blocks
    │   ├── generator.mdx
    │   └── _meta.json
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── _meta.json
    └── sinytra-wiki.json
    ```
</details>

Let's talk about what each of these files does:
- `sinytra-wiki.json`: The main metadata file, the "heart" of the documentation package, carries information about the
project. For its content format, see the complete explanation below.
- `_meta.json`: Can be placed in the root folder as well as each subfolder. Provides display names for files and
folders, which are shown in the documentation navigation sidebar on the wiki, and also specifies the order in which
they are displayed. If not provided, fallback display names are generated automatically.
- `*.mdx` files: Contain documentation contents. To learn more about the MDX format, please see their
[website](https://mdxjs.com/). As MDX compiles to JavaScript, the Wiki imposes certain restrictions on what components
and tags can be used in addition to standard Markdown. For a complete description, please read below.
