# Assets

<Callout>
    Save yourself time manually exporting all assets using our companion [**Gradle plugin**](../features/gradle),
    which integrates with popular mod loader toolchains and can **automatically generate rendered assets** for you!
</Callout>

Assets are used to display images of items, blocks and other project content across the website.

These can be used as part of crafting recipes, sidebar information or custom components.

## Placement

    <FileTreeFolder name="<root>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFolder name=".assets" defaultOpen>
            <FileTreeFolder name="<namespace>" defaultOpen>
                <FileTreeFolder name="gui" defaultOpen>
                    <FileTreeFile name="electric_furnace.png"/>
                    <FileTreeFile name="progress.gif"/>
                </FileTreeFolder>

                <FileTreeFile name="example_item.png" comment="Referenced via <namespace>:example_item"/>
            </FileTreeFolder>
        </FileTreeFolder>
    </FileTreeFolder>
</FileTree>

## Format

Assets are identified using [resource locations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_location) using the same syntax as
in the game itself. It's recommened to match asset names with the in-game IDs of the objects they belong to.

Rendered project assets including **both items and blocks** should be placed under `.assets/(modid)` inside the
documentation directory, where `modid` is the namespace of each texture you wish to provide.

By default, resource locations point to `.png` files. A custom file extension can be appended to the resource location
if the file is of another format.

The name of the file is up to your choice.

For example, the location `examplemod:generator` would point to `<root>/.assets/examplemod/generator.png`.

## Usage

You'll encounter assets being used for various different purposes across the wiki depending on the feature.

The most common use cases include:

- Providing icons for [pages](pages#metadata) by specifying the `icon` frontmatter attribute

- Providing icons for [content pages](pages/content_pages), sourced automatically using the page's `id` frontmatter attribute
as the asset location.

- Showing items in [recipes](game_data)
