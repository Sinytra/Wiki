# Assets

<Callout>
    Save yourself time manually exporting all assets using our companion [**Gradle plugin**](#-gradle-plugin-companion),
    which integrates with popular mod loader toolchains and can **automatically generate rendered assets** for you!

Assets are used to display images of items, blocks and other project content across the website. These can be used as
part of crafting recipes, sidebar information or custom components.

Assets are identified using [resource locations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_location) using the same syntax as
in the game itself. It's recommened to match asset names with the in-game IDs of the objects they belong to.

Rendered project assets including **both items and blocks** should be placed under `.assets/(modid)` inside the
documentation directory, where `modid` is the namespace of each texture you wish to provide.

Each asset **must be in `.png` format**. The name of the file is up to your choice.

For example, `examplemod:generator` would point to `(root)/.assets/examplemod/generator.png`.
