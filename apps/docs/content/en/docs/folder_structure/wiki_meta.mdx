# Wiki metadata

This file acts as the "heart" of the documentation package. It carries basic identifying information about the project
as well as additional metadata that can be used to display information to users.

## Placement

Wiki metadata must be placed in a file called `sinytra-wiki.json` inside the documentation **root directory**.

<FileTree>
    <FileTreeFolder name="<root>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFile name="sinytra-wiki.json"/>
    </FileTreeFolder>
</FileTree>

## Format

Available properties are listed below. Those marked with an asterisk (<span className="text-rose-400!">*</span>)
are **required**.

- `id` <span className="text-rose-400!">*</span>
  - Type: `string`
  - Should be a unique string used to identify your project across the wiki.
  - We recommend using your mod id, or if not available, your CurseForge/Modrinth project slug.
  - May only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (`a-z0-9`) and hyphens (`-`).<br/>
    Must not begin with a number.

- `platforms` <span className="text-rose-400!">*</span>
  - Type: `string -> string`
  - Map of [slugs](#slug) of your project's distribution platforms.
  - Currently supported platforms are `modrinth` and `curseforge`. CurseForge projects may use their unique project ID as well.
  - At least one platform is required

- `modid`
  - Type: `string`
  - In-game mod id, used to identify mod content data
  - Multiple wiki projects may share the same value
  - Required to make use of [game data](game_data)

- `owners`
  - Type: `string[]`
  - Usernames of wiki accounts authorized to register this project<br/>
    *(currently, these are the lowercase forms of respective GitHub username)*
  - Useful for public repositories to prevent unauthorized users from registering the project on the Wiki

- `versions`
  - Type: `string -> string`
  - A map of additional minecraft versions to git branch names to make available.
  - The default branch can not be included - we'll do that automatically

- `licenses`
  - Contains licensing information for the project
  - See the [Licenses](#licenses) section for details

### Licenses

You can add licensing information to your metadata to be displayed on the *project's homepage* instead of relying
on hosting platforms, some of which do not provide this data.

Currently, you can specify a single license under `project`, which corresponds to the license of your origin project
(not the wiki project hosting its documentation!). In other words, this is the license of your
mod/modpack/datapack/etc.

Each license can specify either of a valid SPDX identifier under `id` or an arbitrary name under `name`, but not both at
the same time. In addition to these properties, a `url` pointing to a page with the full license text can be optionally
provided.

Below are some examples:
```json5
{
    // ...
    "licenses": {
        // Specify SPDX identifier only
        "project": {
            "id": "MIT"
        },
        // Specify custom name only
        "project": {
            "name": "MIT License"
        },
        // Specify ID/Name + URL
        "project": {
            "id": "MIT",
            "url": "https://github.com/Example/ExampleMod/blob/master/LICENSE"
        }
    }
}
```

### Finding the project slug [#slug]

The project slug can be easily extracted from your project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
is a placeholder for the actual value.

- For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`

- For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`

## Example

```json filename="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "examplemod",
    "platforms": {
        "curseforge": "example_mod",
        "modrinth": "example-mod"
    },
    "modid": "examplemod",
    "owners": [ "Su5eD" ]
}
```

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/sinytra-wiki.schema.json).

## Versioning

You can show multiple versions of your project's documentation on the wiki by adding a `versions` property to your
docs metadata file, which contains a map of minecraft version names (these will be displayed in the version selector
as well as in the URL paths) to git branch names.

The documentation folder structure remains the same across all branches with contents being isolated per branch,
including assets and localization. **Documentation metadata files (`sinytra-wiki.json`) from other branches are ignored**,
as all necessary information is already contained in the default branch's file.

```json filename="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "versions": {
        "1.19.2": "my-git-branch-name",
        "1.18.2": "another-branch"
    }
}
```
