<Callout type="warning">
    The documentation is a work in progress and certain parts may still be missing.

Learn how to host your project's documentation on the [Modded Minecraft Wiki](https://moddedmc.wiki)!

This guide provides information on local development and the documentation format.
For a guide on publishing docs onto our website, please see the [Publishing](portal/publishing) page instead.

## Prerequisites

In order to start hosting documentation on our wiki, your project only needs to meet a few minimal requirements:

- Be hosted on a Git repository (both private and public repositories work)
- Be approved on either [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)
- At the time of registration, CurseForge projects MUST have the Git repository linked as the project's source code
url (this is currently required to verify project ownership).<br/>
Modrinth projects can also be easily verified using your Modrinth account.

## Gradle plugin companion

We provide an excellent wiki companion [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiToolkit) to help you with
authoring documentation.

Its features include:
- Local real-time, accurate preview of your documentation in the exact same look as it will have once uploaded to the wiki
- Automatically generating asset renders of inventory models for all mod items
- Revalidating documentation after publishing

Find a complete guide on the [Gradle integration](features/gradle) page.
