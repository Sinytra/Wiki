Learn how to document your project using the [Modded Minecraft Wiki](https://moddedmc.wiki)!

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating setting up your project, writing documentation pages,
all the way up to publishing it on the Wiki website.

We'll introduce you to the festures, page format, components and game data integration, allowing you to write dynamic
and interactive content pages.

Read below to get started!

## Prerequisites

In order to start hosting documentation on our wiki, your project only needs to meet a few minimal requirements:

- Be hosted on a Git repository (both private and public repositories work)

- Be approved on either [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)

- At the time of registration, projects must have the Git repository linked as the project's source code
url (this is currently required to verify project ownership)
  - Modrinth projects can also be easily verified by linking your Modrinth account in the Wiki's user settings

## Building & Publishing

1. Navigate to the [Getting Started](getting_started) page to quickstart your project

<p/>

2. Explore the [Folder Structure](folder_structure/overview) to learn about available features and how you can
   customize your documentation

<p/>

3. Integrate your project with [in-game data](features/content_pages) and find handy [tools](features/third-party) in
   the Features section

<p/>

4. [Publish](portal/publishing) your project on the Wiki

## Gradle plugin companion

We provide an excellent wiki companion [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiToolkit) to help you with
authoring documentation.

Its features include:

- Local real-time, accurate **preview of your documentation** in the exact same look as it will have once uploaded to
  the wiki

- Automatically generating **asset renders** of inventory models for all mod items

- **Re-deploying** documentation after publishing

Find a complete guide on the [Gradle integration](features/gradle) page.
