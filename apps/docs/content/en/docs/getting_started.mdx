# Getting Started

Create the directory where your documentation will be located and learn about the wiki folder structure.

<Steps>
    ### Create the documentation root directory

    Start by creating a new directory inside your project. This can be located at any path of your choice.
    For example, you can use `docs/(your modid here)` or simply `docs`, both are equally valid.

    <Callout>
        We also support scenarios where multiple projects have their documentation hosted in a single repository, as long
        as they're located in separate folders.
        This is useful if you're looking to store documentation for multiple of your projects in a single place.
    </Callout>

    ### Configure project metadata

    Inside the newly created directory, create a file named [`sinytra-wiki.json`](folder_structure/wiki_meta),
    which is used to provide basic information about the project.

    Inside, define the following required properties:
    - `id`
      - Should be a unique string used to identify your project across the wiki.
      - We recommend using your mod id, or if not available, your CurseForge/Modrinth project slug.
    - `platforms`
      - Map of slugs of your project's distribution platforms.
      - Currently supported platforms are `modrinth` and `curseforge`. CurseForge projects may use their unique project ID as well.

    <details>
        <Summary>Where do I find the project slug?</Summary>

        The project slug can be easily extracted from your project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
        is a placeholder for the actual value.
        - For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`
        - For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`
    </details>

    A basic example may look as follows:

    ```json filename="sinytra-wiki.json"
    {
        "id": "examplemod",
        "platforms": {
            "curseforge": "example_mod",
            "modrinth": "example-mod"
        }
    }
    ```

    For additional settings, check out the [Wiki Metadata](folder_structure/wiki_meta) page.

    ### You're ready!

    With the metadata file added, you're good to ready to start writing documentation for your mod!

    What you can do next:
    - Familiarize yourself with the wiki [folder structure](folder_structure/overview) and available features
    - Learn about the wiki page [format](features/format) you'll use to write documentation
    - Start writing [pages](folder_structure/pages)!
</Steps>
