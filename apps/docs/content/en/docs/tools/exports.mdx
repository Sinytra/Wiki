# Game data exports

<Callout>
    For the best experience, we recommend using the exporter in combination with our [Gradle plugin](gradle).
</Callout>

The Wiki team maintains a handy [Wiki Data Exporter](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiDataExporter) mod that can
automatically generate in-game inventory renders of item and blocks, as well as various metadata properties that you'd
normally have to extract by hand.

You'll find this especially useful if you're documenting in-game content in your project.

## Features

- Generating 3D item and block renders to be used as [Assets](../folder_structure/assets)

- Exporting [Item Properties](../folder_structure/game_data#item-properties)

- Vast configuration options

## Usage

Full documentation for the mod along with usage instruction is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiDataExporter).
