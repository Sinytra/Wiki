## Wiki Metadata

The wiki metadata file specifies project identification information, necessary for the wiki to load the project.

It must be placed in a file called `sinytra-wiki.json` inside the documentation **root directory**.

```json filename="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "mffs",
    "platforms": {
        "curseforge": "mffs",
        "modrinth": "mffs"
    }
}
```

The wiki metadata file contains the following properties, all of which are **required**:

- `id`: Unique project id used to identify the project across the wiki. We recommend using your mod id
or hosting platform slug.
- `platforms`: Your project's distribution platforms. This is map of (platform) -> (platform project slug).
Currently supported platforms are `modrinth` and `curseforge`. CurseForge projects may use their unique project ID as well.

The project slug can be easily extracted from your project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
is a placeholder for the actual value.
- For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`
- For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/sinytra-wiki.schema.json).

### Versioning

You can show multiple versions of your project's documentation on the wiki by adding a `versions` property to your
docs metadata file, which contains a map of minecraft version names (these will be displayed in the version selector
as well as in the URL paths) to git branch names.

The documentation folder structure remains the same across all branches with contents being isolated per branch,
including assets and localization. **Documentation metadata files (`sinytra-wiki.json`) from other branches are ignored**,
as all necessary information is already contained in the default branch's file.

```json filename="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "versions": {
        "1.19.2": "my-git-branch-name",
        "1.18.2": "another-branch"
    }
}
```
