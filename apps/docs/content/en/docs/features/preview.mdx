# Local preview

The Wiki provides a local previewer that you can use to get a nearly identical preview of your documentation locally
compared to what will be shown once it is published on the website.

## Prerequisites

To run the local previewer, you'll need to do the following:

- [x] Install the Wiki's [Gradle Plugin](gradle) in your project

<p/>

- [x] Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version **24 or above** on your machine

## Usage

To start the local preview, run the `previewDocs` task. This will set up and launch the local wiki environment.

Once ready, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Known issues

Using `org.gradle.daemon=false` will prevent the npm task from existing when gradle is stopped, keeping it running
in the background. Please check your `gradle.properties` file and make sure this property is either set to `true` or
removed entirely.

## Limitations

Certain features may be unailable in local previews do to technical limitations. Placeholders will be shown in their
place where applicable.

These include, but are not limited to:

- CurseForge project information (due to API restrictions on CF's side)

- Game Recipes and Tags
