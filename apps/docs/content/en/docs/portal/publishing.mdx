# Publishing

Learn how to publish your documentation on our website!

---

## Developer portal

You can access our [developer portal](../dev) by clicking the `Developer area` button on the home page or in the footer.

### First login

If this is your first time signing in, you'll be redirected to the login page where you can sign in using
your **GitHub account**.

GitHub will ask you to authorize our GitHub App to access your account. It only requires minimal permissions used to
verify your identify and repository access permissions. Upon approving the request, you'll be automatically taken
to the developer portal.

## Registering projects

To add a new project to the wiki, hit the `Add Project` button. This will open a modal dialog, where you'll be asked
to fill out the following information:

- `Owner` - GitHub repository owner. Can be a user or an organization
- `Name` - GitHub repository name
- `Branch` - Name of the branch where the documentation is located
- `Path to documentation root` - Path to the documentation root folder inside the repository.
Should begin with a leading `/`.

Once you've filled everything out, hit the `Submit` button to complete the registration process.

If the process completed successfully, you're good to go! Try opening the project on the wiki to see the rendered result.

**Should you run into any errors, please see the Troubleshooting section below. If the issue still persists,
[reach out to us](./help).**

<Callout>
    As wiki content is rendered lazily, you may experience slightly increased loading times when first visiting pages,
    but this only occurs the first time a given page is opened and will be **cached for all visitors** afterward,
    achieving near-instant navigation times.
</Callout>

( also don't forget to let your users know they can now find docs for your project here :) )

<Callout>
    If you change your default branch on GitHub (e.g. as when porting your project to newer versions), don't forget to
    update the source branch in the wiki project's settings as well, so that the website can keep showing the latest
    docs version.
</Callout>

#### Troubleshooting

> Please first install our GitHub app on your repository (here).

1. **Possible cause:** The wiki GitHub app is not installed on the project's GitHub repository, and therefore cannot access it.
**Fix:** Navigate to the link provided in the error message and grant the wiki GitHub App access to your repository.
It's enough if you only grant it access to the project's repository rather than all of them at once.
Don't worry about leaving the page - filled out information will be saved and re-applied when you return.

2. **Possible cause:** The provided GitHub repository does not exist.
**Fix:** Make sure you've filled out the repository `Owner` and `Name` fields correctly. These should match each the
repository `owner/name` pair as seen in its URL, e.g. `https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki` would use `Sinytra` as the owner
and `Wiki` as the name.

> Verification error

- **Possible cause:** Your hosting platform project (see [documentation metadata](./devs#wiki-metadata)) does not
provide a Source Code link pointing to your GitHub repository.
**Fix:** For the purposes of verifying project ownership, please momentarily set the Source Code url of your project
to match the GitHub repository url.

> User does not have access to repository.

Your repository access permissions are insufficient to register it to the wiki. Please make sure you have at least
**Maintain** or **Admin** access.

> Invalid path provided

The provided path does not exist or is a regular file. Please make sure the path points to an existing directory within
the repository. There is no need to prefix the path with a branch or tag name.

This field is identical to the `path` parameter of GitHub's "[Get repository content](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-repository-content)"
REST API route.

## Project management

On your developer dashboard, you can find a couple options that let your manage your project. These are described
in detail below.

### Revalidate project

Purges all cached documentation pages, forcing them to be re-rendered lazily on-demand.
This option should only be used upon updating the documentation source itself.

For your own convenience, we recommend automatically revalidating docs after publication using our
[Gradle plugin](./devs#-gradle-plugin-companion) instead.

### Edit project

Edit the project's parameters that have been set during registration. The project's ownership will be re-validated
during an update.

### Delete a project

Permanently delete the project and removes all associated data from our servers. The cache for documentation pages will
be immediately purged as well, but it might take some time to propagate to the CDN and browser clients.

**This is a destructive operation and cannot be undone.**
