# Project management

The project dashboard is where you find all your project information. You can tweak project settings, deploy new
versions, list registered game content and more.

## Deployments

Deployments serve as a version history for Wiki projects. Every time you make changes to your documentation in the
source repository, you'll need to create a new Deployment to publish them on the website.

For your own convenience, we recommend automatically revalidating docs after publication using our
[Gradle plugin](./devs#-gradle-plugin-companion) instead.

## Members

You can grant access to your project to other Wiki users under the "Members" tab.

Members can be added by their Wiki username, which can be found in the [User Settings](https://moddedmc.wiki/en/dev/settings) page.
Generally, this will be the lowercase username of the GitHub account you use to sign in to the Wiki.

<Callout type="warning">
    A user must have an active Wiki account to be added to projects. If you're getting a *User not found* error when
    trying to add your teammates by their GitHub username, make sure they log in to the Wiki first!
</Callout>

### Roles

When adding team members, you can choose between two available roles:

- **Owner** - has **full access** to the project. This includes deleting the project or removing other owners!
- **Member** - can edit project settings and create new deployments. Cannot manage members nor delete the project.

### Leaving projects

Users with the "Member" role may leave projects on their own at any time by using the Members tab.
However, owners can only leave as long as they are not the only owner.
