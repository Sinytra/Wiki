title: Community Wiki Update
date: 2024-10-05
excerpt: In the first major wiki update, we're introducing community docs and UI localization.
---

Even though it's only been a short while since we've officially launched the Modded Minecraft Wiki, we've already
prepared the first large update to the website, which further expands available documentation options and improves the
user experience.

Let's take a deeper look below!

## ü§ù Community documentation

Community-sourced documentation is now available! Any person, whether they're a mod author or not, can document their
favourite mod with no coding knowledge required in a few simple steps. Community projects will show up in the browse tab
just like regular ones, and unofficial documentation will always be explicitly marked as such to avoid confusion in case
of inaccuracies.

### ‚û°Ô∏è But why?

While first-party official documentation can be realiable and is easier to maintain, there are certain cases where it's
more feasible to let the community document mods instead.

- Documenting old mods (writing new docs or migrating existing docs from other wikis where the license allows it)

- Documenting mods where official documentation is unavailable

- Documenting other versions of mods / forks

### ‚û°Ô∏è But how?

Normally, wiki websites store their documentation files in a database and allow anyone with an account to make changes
to content, usually via a built-in editor. However, this requires constant attention to changes being made to the
website in order to keep it free from potential vandalism and spambots.

In addition, our website takes a different approach to how documentation is sourced, as in that we do not store any
files locally. Instead, everything is stored in mods' own GitHub repositories and changes are controlled by mod
authors / other repository maintainers.

Hence, our approach to handling community contributions will differ a little. Rather than the changes being done
directly on the website, we (the Wiki team) will be maintaining a
GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/CommunityWikiDocs) containing all community documentation hosted on the
Wiki, where contributions can be made to.

While this may sound a little difficult to handle for users who do not have experience developing mods / using GitHub,
we have prepared a thorough [guide](https://moddedmc.org/en/about/community) to make sure anyone can contribute to the
docs easily regardless of their experience.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Who maintains community docs?

Changes to community docs will be reviewed by Sinytra's newly-estabilished Wiki team, also called simply "Wiki Editors",
who will have direct control over what changes are made to community documentation. The good news is - anyone can join!
Kinda. We'll soon public an application form for people who wish to be active maintainers.

For everyone else - don't worry! It's not necessary to be an editor in order to submit changes - the team is only in
charge of reviews.

### ‚û°Ô∏è What does this mean for mod developers?

Official and community-sourced documentation will be stored in different places and will remain independent. As a
result, there may be cases where mod devs looking to document their own mod will discover it already being documented by
the community under the Wiki editor team.

There's multiple options you can take here:

1. Use the community docs as a basis for official documentation

2. Keep official and unofficial docs separate (e.g. yours may contain actual specs of mod content, whereas community
   docs will add useful tips and handy setups)

3. Merge community docs into official docs. Feel free to reach out to us if this is the case, and we'll be happy to
   assist with moving the docs from the community repo into the mod's own repository.

## üåê Website translation - a call for help

The wiki's user interface is now fully translatable!

If you speak a foreign language and would like to help us out localizing the website's interface, you can do so on
our [Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/sinytra-wiki), where translations can be submitted publicly. (again, no coding knowledge required!).
In case your language is not shown, please let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.sinytra.org/) and we'll enable it for you.

We'll be very thankful and contributions, and significant onces will be **credited** in the wiki's README on GitHub, as
well as the "[About](https://moddedmc.org/en/about)" page.

## ü™Ñ User interface improvements

### Documentation pages

#### Sticky sidebars

Sidebars now stick to the sides of the page when scrolling, so that you don't need to always return to the top of the
page to navigate away.

#### Table of contents

Pages with hidden metadata will display a table of contents in the right sidebar instead of mod meta information.
Additionally, mod metadata information will remain completely hidden on content pages (e.g. block and item entries) to
leave more space for meta information. Mod metadata can be displayed anytime by navigating to "Mod homepage", located on
the top of the left sidebar.

We'll be adding more customization options for documentation pages in our upcoming update, which will give you more
control over what types of sidebars are shown.

### Author dashboard

The author dashboard has been updated to make it easier for new authors to register projects to the website.

There is also a new diagnostics dialog to help resolve issues with repository access in cases where the wiki can no
longer access the repository or the repository has been moved to a different account.

We've upgraded the project registration modal to reflect new community documentation options as well.

### Project error page

We've added a new error page that will be shown in case a documentation page cannot be accessed by the website. Instead
of a generic error, we'll let the user know what the cause is and give them the option to report this to the mod author
on their repository.
