title: Search & Versions Update
date: 2024-10-27
excerpt: Global search, versioned documentation and new customization options!
---

Our latest wiki update brings 2 new major features to the website - global search and versioning! We've also added new
configuration options for documentation authors and made various improvements to the wiki's UI.

Let's take a deeper look below!

## 🔎 Global search

You can now search the entire website's documentation contents using the navigation header's search bar, allowing you to
query documentation pages as well as mods in one place without having to navigate back-and-forth between docs and the
browse tab. Results will be sorted in order based on relevancy to the searched term, displaying the name of the docs
page, the name of the mod it belongs to, its path on the website and the associated icon (entry asset or mod logo).

## 🔖 Versioning

We have introduced versioned docs to the wiki, allowing mod authors to publish documentation for multiple versions of
their mod at once!

You can show multiple versions of your mod's documentation on the wiki by adding a `versions` property to your  
docs metadata file, which contains a map of minecraft version names (these will be displayed in the version selector  
as well as in the URL paths) to git branch names.

The documentation folder structure remains the same across all branches with contents being isolated per branch,  
including assets and localization. **Documentation metadata files (`sinytra-wiki.json`) from other branches are
ignored**, as all necessary information is already contained in the default branch's file.

Take a look at an example below:

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    ...
    "versions": {
        "1.19.2": "my-git-branch-name",
        "1.18.2": "another-branch"
    }
}
```

## 🏠 Custom homepages

Until now, the mod documentation homepage always displayed its platform (cf/mr) project's description. To further
improve wiki customization options, we've added support for showing your own homepage content using the same familiar
format you use for documentation pages.

To provide your own contents instead, create a `_homepage.mdx` file in your documentation's root folder
(at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`). The file's contents follow the same [formatting](./format) as regular
documentation pages, except for frontmatter metadata (e.g. title), which is ignored.

The homepage's title will always match the mod's name, whereas the sidebar will display various information about the
platform project, such as the project's authors, categories and available mc versions.

## 🚀 Improved callouts

We've added new callout variants to allow authors to better draw the reader's attention to various parts depending
on their importance.

You can choose which variant to show using the `variant` component attribute.

<Callout>This is a sample basic callout</Callout>

Info variant (`info`):

<Callout variant="info">This is a sample info callout</Callout>

Warning variant (`warning`):

<Callout variant="warning">This is a sample warning callout</Callout>

Danger / error variant (`danger`):

<Callout variant="danger">This is a sample danger callout</Callout>

## 🐿️ Icons for everyone

We've made the entire collection of [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) available for use in documentation files
via React components.

Names of icon components consist of an icon's "component name" (which you can find on the website or make an educated
guess by converting the icon id to PascalCase (e.g. `align-vertical-justify-start` -> `AlignVerticalJustifyStart`)
and the `Icon` suffix. All properties supported by [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) are
available as well.

For example:

```jsx
<SquirrelIcon width={32} height={32} strokeWidth={1.5} />
```

Results in:

<SquirrelIcon width={32} height={32} strokeWidth={1.5} />

### Sidebar usage

You can add icons for each metadata entry to display in the navigation sidebar by converting the meta value to an object
and supplying the icon's name as shown below.

The supplied icon name should be a [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) component name (without the `Icon` suffix).

```json title="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": {
        "name": "Blocks",
        "icon": "Box"
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Miscellaneous changes

- 💡 Added support for arbitrary asset extensions (you can show GIFs in your docs now!).
  Example usage: `examplemod:tea.gif` resolves to `.assets/item/examplemod/tea.gif`

- Sidebar headings are indented

- 💡 Codeblocks can now display file names by writing `title="example.json"` after the language definition, where
  `example.json` is your desired file name to show

- 💡 It is now possible to verify project ownership status by a single-time login to modrinth. If necessary, you'll be
  prompted with this option during project registration.

- Fixed local preview for CurseForge projects. As the CF api is inaccessible locally, we'll display placeholder project
metadata until the project is uploaded to the website.

- Mod asset components are no longer wrapped in divs
