Our latest wiki update brings a brand new experimental backend to improve our services as well as further improvements
to caching and wiki scalability.

Let's take a deeper look below!

## 🧪 New experimental backend

We've equipped the website with a new experimental [backend](https://github.com/Sinytra/WikiService) to address
long-running issues with caching and poor page load times (usually as a result slow external API queries).

Decoupling the frontend from tasks related to data processing and moving them to a separate service allows us to run
heavier computations for longer times, with finer control over concurrent access. As the website grows and wikis
become larger and more demanding on compute, we should be able to maintain the same performance even during peak
usage times.

In addition, the new backend allows us to run more analytics-related tasks, which will come in handy when we introduce
support for custom recipes.

For now, documentation pages have been migrated to the backend service. In the future, we intend to migrate
the rest of dynamic user interactions, such as database access or content reporting. 

### Track the website status

The uptime of all related services can be found at our new [Status page](https://status.moddedmc.org/), which you can
also find in the wiki page footer.

## 🖼️ Custom embeds

Each mod page now gets their own embed image to show off on social media, including the homepage and non-content pages.

This means anytime you link a page on Discord, Reddit, Mastodon or your other favourite websites, the wiki will show
a preview of the page contents instead of the generic wiki embed we've had until now.

### Mod homepage

The mod's homepage will display the mod name, the project summary and mod icon.

    </a>
}/>

### Content page

Content pages will show the page title, origin mod name and optionally the content icon.

    </a>
}/>

### Non-content page

Non-content pages will display the page title and the origin mod name.
