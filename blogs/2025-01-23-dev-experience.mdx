excerpt: New developer dashboard and precise project management
---

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the overall developer experience and project management on the
wiki, making it feel less of a "black box" experience and providing verbose project information to developers.

At the same time, we've improved mobile support for the wiki and added new components to use in documentation pages.

Let's dive into all the new features below!

## Faster project load times

Previously, the wiki loaded pages "lazily" by fetching them from the GitHub repository specified in project settings.
However, issuing several API calls every time a page was rendered ended up being too slow, and we've decided to
rework this system into one that's more eager.

Our new solution involves cloning the entire git repository on the backend and serving wiki pages from local storage,
leading to massive improvements to page loading speeds. At the same time, this allows developers to keep precise track
of how their project is loaded into the system and discover errors immediately at the time of registering.

Additionally, this new system will allow us to further expand our wiki to any accept any Git repository, not only those
hosted on GitHub. Stay tuned!

## Developer experience overhaul

The simple developer project list has been upgraded to an actual multipurpose dashboard that also sets the basis for
future account management features. For now, the only available page is the Project list, but more will be coming.

The new dashboard uses the same user-friendly approach as the old one did, now giving developers broader and more
precise management & monitoring capabilities over their projects.

### Project management

Selecting a project from the dashboard list leads to a brand-new Project overview page that contains all the tools
and data you need to keep track of your project's status and fix potential errors with your configuration / metadata.

The Project overview page begins with an overview of the project, displaying the name and summary imported from one of
its hosting platforms.

Underneath you can find a toolbar with various tools:
- **View** - open the live project documentation home page
- **Reload** - re-downloads documentation pages on the server
(does not update project metadata - use "Settings" instead)
- **Settings** - opens project source settings
- **Delete** - open project deletion dialog

Below the toolbar, the overview page gives you raw **metadata information** about the project and its **deployment status**,
including **server-side logs**.

## Miscellaneous changes

### Improved mobile UI

The wiki now has proper support for global search on mobile devices. Navbar links have been moved into a hamburger menu
to support a wider range of screen resolutions.

</div>

### Code tabs

Multi-tab code blocks are now available for use in documentation! These can be useful if you want to merge multiple
related code blocks into one, or provide alternative syntax (such as old / new API usage).

See the [Documentation format](/en/about/format#code-tabs) page for syntax & usage information.

<CodeTabs tabs={[
    {
        lang: 'js',
        meta: 'main.js',
        value: `function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor)
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : []
}`
    },
    {
        lang: 'css',
        meta: 'styles.css',
        value: `body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}`
    }
]}/>
