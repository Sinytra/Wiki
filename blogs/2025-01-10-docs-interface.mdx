We're excited to bring you the latest wiki update, which includes a major UI overhaul of the wiki's homepage and
documentation pages. Additionally, we're adding support for linking both CurseForge and Modrinth platform pages at once.

Let's dive into all the new features below!

## Fancy docs UI

Thanks to <a className="text-secondary" href="https://imb11.dev/">@IMB11</a>'s amazing design work, we're
proud to present a new UI layout of multiple parts of the wiki.

### Homepage

The homepage has been completely overhauled to be more informative and appealing to wiki users. We've also added
a new element that displays trending projects, worth checking out!

We've made sure to maintain fast navigation to key features, such as browsing projects and accessing the developer
dashboard.

The bottom part of the homepage shows the latest blog post (which is probably where you found this one, too!) and
a brief description of us maintainers.

### Documentation

The new documentation layout moves sidebars to the very edges of the screen and gives content more reading space.

The footer gives quick access to switching docs versions and languages, as well as page editing and changelog options.

Mobile support is included by default.

## Multiplatform support

We now support specifying multiple hosting platforms in the wiki metadata file (`sinytra-wiki.json`). These are
currently CurseForge and Modrinth.

The old format using `slug` and `platform` will remain supported, but we recommend migrating to the new spec nevertheless.

Hosting platforms can now be specified under the `platforms` property, where the keys represent platforms and values
are respective project slugs.

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "mffs",
    "platforms": {
        "curseforge": "mffs",
        "modrinth": "mffs"
    }
}
```
