## What data do we collect?

### User data

When you log in to the website using your GitHub account, we access your public GitHub profile information for the
purposes of displaying it on the developer dashboard, which is only visible to you.

We do not store any of this information, and it is only retained for the duration of the website being rendered,
after which it is discarded immediately.

## Third parties

We use some third-party services to make our website run.
Please refer to each of their privacy policies for more information:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/trust-hub/gdpr/)
- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy)
- [Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/privacy-policy)

Data that we specifically collect isn't shared with any other third party. We do not sell any data.

## Cookies

We use cookies to log you into your account.

Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard Internet information.
For more information, please visit [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/).

You can set your browser not to accept cookies, and the above website tells you how to remove cookies from your browser.
However, in a few cases, some of our website features may not function as a result.

## Consent

By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its [Terms and Conditions](./tos).

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We keep this privacy policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page. If we do this, we will post
the changes on this page and update the "Last edited" date at the top of this page, after which such changes will
become effective immediately. We will make an effort to keep users updated on any such changes, but because most changes
do not affect how we process existing data, a notice will not be sent for all changes.
