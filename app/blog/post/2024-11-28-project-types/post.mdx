# Document more than just mods

One could call the latest wiki update a multidimensional one. And that's for a reason - we now support 6 project types
that can be documented on the wiki!

These include:
- <BoxIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-green-500" /> **Mods**
- <PackageOpenIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-orange-500" /> **Modpacks**
- <PaintbrushIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-sky-500" /> **Resource packs**
- <BracesIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-rose-500" /> **Data packs**
- <UnplugIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-amber-500" /> **Plugins**
- <SwatchBookIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-1 inline-block text-fuchsia-500" /> **Shaders**

If there's enough demand, we're always open to adding more in the future as well.

Let's dive into all the new features below!

## 🎨 New project types

When we first started the wiki, our focus was on providing a place for devs to publish documentation
for their mods.

However, as we've progressed, we found that mods are not the only projects that often publish documentation or come
with some kind of user guide. These projects [face the same trouble](/blog/post/2024-09-10-introduction#present-options)
as mods when looking at hosting options for their docs, and we'd like to fill the gap in this area, too.

The wiki's functionality has been expanded and adapted to now support **multiple types** of projects.
Whatever your project is, if it's related to minecraft, there's a good chance we support it!

As mentioned above, there are now in total **6 types of projects** that can be documented. The process
and approach remains the same regardless of the projects, e.g. docs are hosted on GitHub and actively
crawled by the wiki. **Community documentation** can be created for non-mod projects as well.

**No additional steps** are required - the project type is **automatically chosen** when you register your project on
the wiki based on information provided by the hosting platform.

## 🔎 Improved browse page

Along with adding more project types, we've improved the project browse page to including new filter and sorting
options for search.

The search algorithm now uses postgresql's built-in [full text search](https://neon.tech/docs/data-types/tsvector)
algorithm to provide even more accurate results, taking into account more than just the project id.

We now also display the type for each project to better distinguish them in the list. We'll be working on adding
more filter options and displayed meta information in the future.

## 🔧 Misc changes

- 🐛 Fixed issues related to project revalidation not refreshing page data sources

- 🐛 Fixed an issue where projects would not be shown on the dev dashboard due to the filter being case-sensitive

- 🐛 Fixed an issue where the dev dashboard would try to use an expired GitHub token,
resulting in no projects being displayed
