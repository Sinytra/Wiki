# Sinytra Modded Minecraft Wiki

The Modded Minecraft Wiki is built to suit the very needs of Minecraft modders and players alike. It provides
intuitive navigation, a clean user interface, mod browser and features for authors to make writing documentation
a piece of cake.

These include versioning, localization, custom components (recipes, assets, etc.), gradle integration,
project management and more.

- üåê **Localization**: Translate your docs into world languages
- üöπ **Accessible**: Intuitive and responsive user interface
- ü§ù **Open**: Let your users contribute without any programming knowledge necessary
- üí∏ **Free**: Hosting docs on our website is completely free of charge!

## Authors

**üìò Read the complete author guide [here](https://docs.moddedmc.wiki).**

An example documentation setup can be found in the `example` directory of this repository.

## Development

Ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. 

1. Install dependecies by running `pnpm install`
2. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
3. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the app

To open the example project, enable local preview mode by setting `ENABLE_LOCAL_PREVIEW=true` or manually navigate
to `/project/examplemod`.

You can list desired local documentation sources in the `LOCAL_DOCS_ROOTS` env variable as demonstrated in the example.
