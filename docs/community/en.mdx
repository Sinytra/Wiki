**🌐 The central repository for community documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Sinytra/CommunityWikiDocs).**

The README of the repo is displayed below:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Sinytra/CommunityWikiDocs?quickstart=1)

A collection of community documentation for the [Modded Minecraft Wiki](https://moddedmc.org/).

📖 This repository serves as a source of unofficial documentation for minecraft mods contributed by the community
and maintained by the Modded Minecraft Wiki developer team / Sinytra.

📂 Each subdirectory (with the exception of `gradle`) contains a Wiki project with documentation files and metadata. 
Registration of projects to the Wiki is handled automatically.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome all contributions - no coding knowledge is required!

1. Start by opening the repository in your favourite editor or IDE.  
   You can also use [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/Sinytra/CommunityWikiDocs?quickstart=1) in the browser
   for a quick setup (supports live previews, too!).

2. Launch a local preview by running `./gradlew previewDocs` in the terminal and wait until the environment has finished
   setting up.

3. Once the preview instance is ready, the editor will prompt you to open it in a new tab. Click `Open in Browser`.  
   Alternatively, you can find a link in the `PORTS` tab next to the terminal.

4. You're ready to start editing docs! 🎉

To learn more about the documentation file format used, see [this page](https://moddedmc.org/en/about/format).

### Existing projects

Making changes to existing projects is fairly simple. Find the project you'd like to update and make desired changes
to documentation files. Once you're done, commit your working tree and [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/Sinytra/CommunityWikiDocs/compare)
with your changes.

### New projects

Adding new projects can be done in two easy steps:

1. Create a subdirectory for the mod you're going to document. The name of this directory should match the value of the
`id` field in the project [metadata file](https://moddedmc.org/en/about/devs#wiki-metadata).

2. Add the name of the subdirectory to the `documentation_roots` property inside `gradle.properties`.
