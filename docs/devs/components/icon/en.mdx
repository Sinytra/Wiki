# Icon

The entire collection of [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) is available to use in documentation files via
React components.

Names of icon components consist of an icon's "component name" (which you can find on the website or make an educated
guess by converting the icon id to PascalCase (e.g. `align-vertical-justify-start` -> `AlignVerticalJustifyStart`)
and the `Icon` suffix. All properties supported by [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) are
available as well.

## Code

```jsx
<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1.5} />
```

## Result

<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1.5} />
