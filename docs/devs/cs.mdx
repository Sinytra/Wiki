# Developers

Get started hosting your mod's documentation on our wiki!

This guide provides information on local development and the documentation format.
For a guide on publishing docs onto our website, please see the [Publishing](./publishing) page instead.

## Prerequisites

In order to start hosting documentation on our wiki, your mod only needs to meet a few minimal requirements: 

- Be hosted on a <GitHubIcon className="inline-block mb-1 mx-1" width={16} height={16} /> GitHub repository
  (both private and public repositories work!)
- Be approved on either
  <ModrinthIcon className="inline-block mb-1 mx-1 text-[var(--modrinth-brand)]" width={16} height={16} /> [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) or
  <CurseForgeIcon className="inline-block mb-0.5 mx-1 text-[var(--curseforge-brand)]" width={16} height={16} /> [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)
- Have the GitHub repository linked as the mod's source code url on the respective hosting website\
  (this is currently required to verify project ownership)

Additionally, the person registering the project to the wiki should have **Maintain** or **Admin** access to its
GitHub repository.

## Folder structure

Start by creating a new directory inside your project. This can be located at any path of your choice.\
For example, you can use `docs/(your modid here)` or simply `docs`, both are equally valid.

<Callout>
    We also support scenarios where multiple mods' documentation is hosted in a single repository, as long as they're in
    separate folders.  
    This is useful if you'd like to host documentation for multiple of your mods in a single place.
</Callout>

A minimal example folder layout may look like this:

```
docs
├── blocks
│   ├── generator.mds
│   └── _meta.json
├── introduction.mdx
├── _meta.json
└── sinytra-wiki.json
```

<details>
    <summary>Show complete example</summary>
    
    Here is a complete example including assets and translations.
    
    ```
    docs
    ├── .assets
    │   └── item
    │       └── examplemod
    │           └── generator.png
    ├── .translated
    │   └── de_de
    │       └── blocks
    │           ├── generator.mdx
    │           └── _meta.json
    ├── blocks
    │   ├── generator.mds
    │   └── _meta.json
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── _meta.json
    └── sinytra-wiki.json
    ```
</details>

Let's talk about what each of these files does:

- `sinytra-wiki.json`: The main metadata file, the "heart" of the documentation package, carries information about the
  project. For its content format, see the complete explanation below.
- `_meta.json`: Can be placed in the root folder as well as each subfolder. Provides display names for files and
  folders, which are shown in the documentation navigation sidebar on the wiki, and also specifies the order in which
  they are displayed. If not provided, fallback display names are generated automatically.
- `*.mdx` files: Contain documentation contents. To learn more about the MDX format, please see their
  [website](https://mdxjs.com/). As MDX compiles to JavaScript, the Wiki imposes certain restrictions on what components
  and tags can be used in addition to standard Markdown. For a complete description, please read below.

### Assets

<Callout>
    Save yourself time manually exporting all assets using our companion [**Gradle plugin**](#-gradle-plugin-companion),
    which integrates with popular mod loader toolchains and can **automatically generate rendered assets** for you!
</Callout>

Assets are used to display images of items, blocks and other mod content across the website. These can be used as part
of crafting recipes, sidebar information or custom components.

Assets are identified using [resource locations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_location) using the same syntax as
in the game itself. It's recommened to match asset names with the in-game IDs of the objects they belong to.

Rendered mod assets including **both items and blocks** should be placed under `.assets/item/(modid)` inside the
documentation directory, where `modid` is the namespace of each texture you wish to provide.

Each asset **must be in `.png` format**. The name of the file is up to your choice.

For example, `examplemod:generator` would point to `(root)/.assets/item/examplemod/generator.png`.

### Translation

Documentation can be localized into various languages supported by the wiki. A complete list can be found in the
language selection dropdown located on the right-most part of the navigation header.

Localized files must be placed under `.translated/(lang)` inside the documentation directory, where
`(lang)` is the desired language code in `(lang)_(region)` format. Currently, all regions match the language, so
it's sufficient to take the target language code and complete the region to be the same as the language
(e.g. German translations (`de`) would be placed under `.translated/de_de`).

The localized folder structure follows the same layout as root. Both documentation content files (`.mdx`) and folder
metadata (`_meta.json`) may be translated. Translated content takes precedence over the default locale when being
loaded. However, untranslated files will still be shown even when the locale is non-default, therefore it is
recommended to translate all files whenever possible.

### Custom homepage

The wiki provides a dedicated landing page for documentation called the "Mod homepage". By default, this shows the
linked platform project's description.

If you'd like to provide your own contents instead, you can do so by creating a `_homepage.mdx` file in your
documentation's root folder (at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`). The file's contents follow the same
[formatting](./format) as regular documentation pages, except for frontmatter metadata (e.g. title), which is ignored.
The homepage's title will always match the mod's name, whereas the sidebar will display various information about the
platform project, such as the project's authors, categories and available mc versions.

## Documentation format

### Wiki Metadata

The wiki metadata file specifies project identification information, necessary for the wiki to load the project.

It must be placed in a file called `sinytra-wiki.json` inside the documentation **root directory**.

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "mffs",
    "platform": "modrinth",
    "slug": "mffs"
}
```

The wiki metadata file contains the following properties, all of which are **required**:

- `id`: Unique project id used to identify the project across the wiki. We recommend using your mod id
  or hosting platform slug.
- `platform`: Your mod's distribution platform. Can be either of `modrinth` or `curseforge`.
- `slug`: The host platform's project slug.

The project slug can be easily extracted from your mod's project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
is a placeholder for the actual value.

- For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`  
- For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/sinytra-wiki.schema.json).

### Folder metadata

Provides additional information for the documentation page navigation sidebar:

- The **display names** of folders and files. If not provided, the wiki will use automatically generated display names.
- The **ordering** of sidebar entries. By default, folders are shown first, followed by regular files, all sorted
  alphabetically.

To avoid potential unwanted display errors, we recommend **always** providing complete folder metadata in your
documentation.

```json title="\_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": "Blocks",
    "items": "Completely custom name",
    "introduction.mdx": "Introduction"
}
```

The folder metadata json consists of string key-value pairs, where the keys represent the name of a file or a folder,
and the values are their display name. When specifying a file name, the full name including the extension is required.

Folder metadata is contained in a file called `_meta.json` and can be placed **inside any folder** within the
documentation directory, **including the root** directory itself (e.g. at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`).

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/_meta.schema.json).

#### Icons

You can add icons for each metadata entry to display in the navigation sidebar by converting the meta value to an object
and supplying the icon's name as shown below.

The supplied icon name should be a [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) component name (without the `Icon` suffix).
More information on icon names can be found on the [Format](./format#icons) page.

```json title="\_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": {
        "name": "Blocks",
        "icon": "Box"
    }
}
```

### Versioning

You can show multiple versions of your mod's documentation on the wiki by adding a `versions` property to your
docs metadata file, which contains a map of minecraft version names (these will be displayed in the version selector
as well as in the URL paths) to git branch names.

The documentation folder structure remains the same across all branches with contents being isolated per branch,
including assets and localization. **Documentation metadata files (`sinytra-wiki.json`) from other branches are ignored**,
as all necessary information is already contained in the default branch's file.

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    ...
    "versions": {
        "1.19.2": "my-git-branch-name",
        "1.18.2": "another-branch"
    }
}
```
