## Configuration

### Wiki Metadata

The wiki metadata file specifies project identification information, necessary for the wiki to load the project.

It must be placed in a file called `sinytra-wiki.json` inside the documentation **root directory**.

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "mffs",
    "platforms": {
        "curseforge": "mffs",
        "modrinth": "mffs"
    }
}
```

The wiki metadata file contains the following properties, all of which are **required**:

- `id`: Unique project id used to identify the project across the wiki. We recommend using your mod id
or hosting platform slug.
- `platforms`: Your project's distribution platforms. This is map of (platform) -> (platform project slug).
Currently supported platforms are `modrinth` and `curseforge`. CurseForge projects may use their unique project ID as well.

The project slug can be easily extracted from your project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
is a placeholder for the actual value.
- For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`
- For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/sinytra-wiki.schema.json).

### Folder metadata

Provides additional information for the documentation page navigation sidebar:
- The **display names** of folders and files. If not provided, the wiki will use automatically generated display names.
- The **ordering** of sidebar entries. By default, folders are shown first, followed by regular files, all sorted
alphabetically.

To avoid potential unwanted display errors, we recommend **always** providing complete folder metadata in your
documentation.

```json title="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": "Blocks",
    "items": "Completely custom name",
    "introduction.mdx": "Introduction"
}
```

The folder metadata json consists of string key-value pairs, where the keys represent the name of a file or a folder,
and the values are their display name. When specifying a file name, the full name including the extension is required.

Folder metadata is contained in a file called `_meta.json` and can be placed **inside any folder** within the
documentation directory, **including the root** directory itself (e.g. at the same level as `sinytra-wiki.json`).

The JSON Schema specification for this file can be found [here](/_meta.schema.json).

#### Icons

You can add icons for each metadata entry to display in the navigation sidebar by converting the meta value to an object
and supplying the icon's name as shown below.

The supplied icon name should be a [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) component name (without the `Icon` suffix).
More information on icon names can be found on the [Format](./format#icons) page.

To hide the folder icon completely, specify `null`.

```json title="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": {
        "name": "Blocks",
        "icon": "Box"
    }
}
```

### Versioning

You can show multiple versions of your project's documentation on the wiki by adding a `versions` property to your
docs metadata file, which contains a map of minecraft version names (these will be displayed in the version selector
as well as in the URL paths) to git branch names.

The documentation folder structure remains the same across all branches with contents being isolated per branch,
including assets and localization. **Documentation metadata files (`sinytra-wiki.json`) from other branches are ignored**,
as all necessary information is already contained in the default branch's file.

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    ...
    "versions": {
        "1.19.2": "my-git-branch-name",
        "1.18.2": "another-branch"
    }
}
```
