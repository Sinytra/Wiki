# Documentation format

The wiki uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files as its documentation format. In additon, [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
(GFM) is also available using [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). 

If you're not yet familiar with MDX, don't worry - it is an extension of the simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
format with added JSX capabilities, meaning you can include fancy custom components in your documentation,
such as crafting recipes.

These features are purely optional, and you can always stick to using standard Markdown in your documentation. However,
the file extension must remain `.mdx`.

#### Limitations

Because MDX can potentially allow unwanted code injection on the server, we sanitize all sources before they're rendered,
which can result in certain features of MDX being unavailable. That said, if there's a safe feature you'd like to use in
your documentation that isn't available on the wiki, please open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki/issues).

## Metadata

Markdown page metadata, also known as simply "Frontmatter" is used by the wiki to provide additional information about
a page or in-game content. It's located at the very beginning of each file in YAML format.

Information obtained from frontmatter is then displayed in the right sidebar of each page under "Information".
Usually, this includes an icon of the block/item along with its name, id, source mod and other handy information.

If your page is not related to a specific object, you can hide all metadata and ignore their values by setting
`hide_meta: true`. The `title` attribute will still be used, and we recommend providing it at all times.

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
---

Content comes here
```

Here's an overview of supported attributes:

- `title` - Display name of the page, shown in the content heading and the browser tab title.
  Replaces the `h1` heading in docs.
  - Type: `string`
  - Example: `Fancy Block`
- `hide_meta` - Hides sidebar meta information. As a results, all other attributes will be ignored.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `id` - In-game resource location ID of the content shown. If a matching asset with the same location is found in the
  documentation root's asset folder, it will be used as the `icon`.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:generator`
- `icon` - Resource location of an asset that will be shown as the documented item's icon. Its size should be at least
  128x128 pixels.
  - Type: Resource Location
  - Example: `examplemod:fancy_generator`
- `hide_icon` - Hides the project icon, showing a generic placeholder instead.
  - Type: `boolean`
- `type` - Can be `block`, `item` or `other`
  - Type: `string`
- `custom` - A map of custom attributes you wish to display in the sidebar.
  - Type: `string` -> `string` map
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    custom:
      Category: Machines
    ```

<details>
    <summary>Show complete metadata example</summary>
    
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Generator
    id: examplemod:generator
    icon: examplemod:fancy_generator
    type: block
    custom:
      Subcategory: Machines
    ---
    
    Content comes here
    ```
</details>

## Custom components

The wiki adds a selection of useful components that you can use in your documentation.

Import statements are not required for built-in wiki components.

### Crafting recipe

- `slots` - Exactly 9 resource location strings (asset names), in order from top-left to bottom-right.
- `result` - Resource location of the resulting item asset
- `count` - Optionally, specify the output item amount

※ Images shown in crafting recipes are sourced from documentation assets as described [here](./devs#assets).

```jsx
<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'flint',
        'minecraft:flint', // Hint: the namespace is optional for 'minecraft' items
        'flint',
        '',
        'iron_block',
        '',
        '',
        'diamond',
        ''
    ]}
    result="furnace"
    count={4} // Optional
/>
```

Results in:

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'flint',
        'minecraft:flint',
        'flint',
        '',
        'iron_block',
        '',
        '',
        'diamond',
        ''
    ]}
    result="furnace"
    count={4}
/>

### Callouts

Draw the reader's attention with callouts.

Available attributes:

- `variant` Optional; can be either of [`default`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`] (default: `default`)

```jsx
<Callout>
    This is a sample callout
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info">
    This is a sample info callout
</Callout>

/* Other variants shown below */
```

Results in:

<Callout>This is a sample callout</Callout>

Info variant:

<Callout variant="info">This is a sample info callout</Callout>

Warning variant:

<Callout variant="warning">This is a sample warning callout</Callout>

Danger variant:

<Callout variant="danger">This is a sample danger callout</Callout>

### Mod Asset

Displays an [asset](./devs#assets) image.

Available attributes:

- `location` Required, Resource Location of the asset you wish to display
- All properties of `img` except for `src` are accepted

```jsx
<Asset width={64} height={64} location="minecraft:furnace" title="Force Field Projector" />
```

Results in:

<Asset width={64} height={64} location="minecraft:furnace" title="Force Field Projector" />

### Icons

The entire collection of [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) is available to use in documentation files via
React components.

Names of icon components consist of an icon's "component name" (which you can find on the website or make an educated
guess by converting the icon id to PascalCase (e.g. `align-vertical-justify-start` -> `AlignVerticalJustifyStart`)
and the `Icon` suffix. All properties supported by [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) are
available as well.

For example:

```jsx
<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1.5} />
```

Results in:

<SquirrelIcon width={64} height={64} strokeWidth={1.5} />

## Next steps

Once your documentation folder is set up, and you're satisfied with the looks and content of your documentation,
it is time to get it published on the wiki.
